# Vallox to Home Assistant - Python / MQTT implementation
The intent of this project is to implement Home Assistant device for [Vallox 150 SE](https://www.vallox.com/en/product/vallox-150-effect-se/) home ventilator.
The actual interface is direct Python port from [ValloxEsp serial interface](https://github.com/kotope/valloxesp/tree/master) by [@kotope](https://github.com/kotope).
The MQTT implementation (work in progress) is intended to expose the device to Home Assistant using device discovery protocol.
